"use strict";
let helloWorld = "Why learn TypeScript right?";
//  ^?

```

Hmmm, right now in this time of my development I am learning TypeScript to build native apps. JavaScript(JS) the language that I love and want to master. I have been learning VanillaJS ES6 so for me the question is why would I want to learn TS right?

- why was it created? 
- TS is a subset of JS a type of JS wrapper compiles to clean JS output?
