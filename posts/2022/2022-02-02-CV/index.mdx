## Github pages online CV

Taught a class of 20 mature students successfully, how to design, build and host a personal online Curriculum Vitae (CV), learning some Git CLI along the way we get to host for free with [Github pages](https://pages.github.com/) noice !

For me as a dev, an online CV is a great way to share your CV while improving and showing off your front end web development skills.

For the original Course material I used Bootstrap [thewhitefox github bootstrap tut](http://thewhitefox.github.io/git-github-bootstrap-tut) this slideshow / course material was created using [reveal js](https://revealjs.com/)

I decided to move to a more modern CSS way of styling TailwindCSS and with a tv legend Tony Soprano (you gonna refuse him a job?) I created my version of his CV [http://thewhitefox.github.io/cv-demo/](http://thewhitefox.github.io/cv-demo/)

As you will see originally CV was created with [getbootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) I have since swapped that out for
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.
Also using: 
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation of Frontend Tooling

[Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - Open source icons. Lovingly hand-crafted.

```
