Teaching a class of 20 students Structured Query Language (SQL - pronounced "ess-que-el") Fun-damentals.
The following is a lesson plan I wrote and taught.

## Aggregate functions

Perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value. Except for COUNT, aggregate functions ignore null values. Aggregate functions are frequently used with the GROUP BY clause of the SELECT statement.

Useful aggregate functions:

- AVG() - Returns the average value
- COUNT() - Returns the number of rows
- FIRST() - Returns the first value
- LAST() - Returns the last value
- MAX() - Returns the largest value
- MIN() - Returns the smallest value
- SUM() - Returns the sum

## HAVING

The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate
functions.

```
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM (Orders
INNER JOIN Employees
ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName
HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 10;

```

Result:

| LastName | NumberOfOrders |
| :------- | :------------- |
| OConnor  | 11             |
| Henry    | 27             |
| Chinaski | 14             |

```
SELECT Employees.LastName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID=Employees.EmployeeID WHERE LastName=OConnor OR LastName=Henry GROUP BY LastName HAVING COUNT(Orders.OrderID) > 25;
```

Result:

| LastName | NumberOfOrders |
| :------- | :------------- |
| Henry    | 27             |

### CAST

Converts an expression of one data type to another in SQL Server.
Syntax for CAST:
CAST ( expression AS data_type [ ( length ) ] )

Table Student_Score
Column Name Data Type
StudentID integer
First_Name char(20)
Score float

Table Student_Score Rows

| StudentID | First_Name | Score |
| :-------- | :--------- | :---- |
| 1         | Jenny      | 85.2  |
| 2         | Bob        | 92.5  |
| 3         | Alice      | 90    |
| 4         | James      | 120.1 |

### Example 1

SELECT First_Name, CAST(Score AS Integer) Int_Score FROM Student_Score;

Result:

| First_Name | Int_Score |
| :--------- | :-------- |
| Jenny      | 85        |
| Bob        | 92        |
| Alice      | 90        |
| James      | 120       |

## Table Relationships

Some tables contain information related to other tables.

### Join

Using the join statement, SQL has powerful tools for extracting related data from multiple tables. Typically
unique id fields are used to create relationships. Unique id fields work well for creating and managing simple or
complex relationships between tables. When a result is needed from multiple rows in multiple tables use a join
query. The easiest way to understand joins is by using a venn diagram. Matching ids The simplest most
common join is the inner join, this is the default join. Many databases including SQLite do not support a right
join or full other join. Inter section of the tables, where the tables overlap a condition is met.

### Exercise: Joins

Create a new databasewith the following SQL
Select both tables
Create a basic join. ON l.id = r.id; // join on the rows that the condition is met
All the results from the left column and the inner join.

```
Join SELECT * FROM Orders INNER JOIN Customers;

SELECT firstName, lastName, orderAmount FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders ON CustomerID =
CustomerID;

```

### View

A view stores the select statement as a table.

```
CREATE VIEW employeeName AS
SELECT firstName, lastName, FROM emloyees
Select all from the view.
SELECT * FROM employeeName
```

### GRANT statement

Use the GRANT statement to give privileges to a specific user or role, or to all users, to perform actions on
database objects. You can also use the GRANT statement to grant a role to a user, to PUBLIC, or to another
role.

`GRANT privilege-type ON [TABLE] { table-Name | view-Name } TO grantees `

Example

To grant the SELECT privilege on table Managers to all users, use the following:
```
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE Managers to PUBLIC

From your CLI, run SQLite3.exe create new database.

sqlite>../sqlite3.exe PatsClothesShop.db
Customer Order

sqlite> CREATE TABLE Customer(
costumerID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
firstName CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
lastName CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
address VARCHAR(200),
city CHAR(10),
county CHAR(10),
creditLimit....... REAL,
costomerSince DATETIME
);

sqlite> CREATE TABLE Order(
orderID INT PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
orderDate DATETIME NOT NULL,
orderAmount REAL,
paymentType INT,
customerID INT NOT NULL
);

sqlite>.tables
Customer Order

sqlite>.header on
sqlite>.mode column
sqlite>.timer on

```

Insert 5 customers like below

```
INSERT INTO Customers (firstName, lastName, address, city, county, creditLimit,
costomerSince)
VALUES (1, 'Paul', 'Murphy' 32, 'Apt 1', 'Dublin', 15000.00, '2007-01-01 10:00:00' );
```

XML eXtensible Markup Language

Similar to HTML in it’s use of the tags <></>

XML contains self-describing structured data but omits presentation (formatting) information.
XML is used to store or transfer data between disparate computing platforms, operating systems, software
application, etc.

XML is an open standard, as opposed to a proprietary data format.
Common easily readable format for computer and humans, very portable.
XML used extensively in the .NET Framework.

XML’s relationship to ADO.NET Datasets

Allows for a disconnected means of working with data, then allows for easy synchronization of changes back to
the original data store.

• XML is used for syndicated RSS feeds
• XML is used to store or transfer data between disparate computing  
• XML contains self-describing

Create an XML file called cars.
Create a root element /node carcollection, all XML documents have to have a root element.
Inside the carcollection element /node create two elements called car these are the sub elements
/children of carcollection.
Inside the car elements create a sub-element called make.
It can one or the other but not both or it can contain an attribute.
Tag name are created by the programmer.

Pretty much free form, however follow a pattern to make it readable for others and yourself.
A need for consentience valid documents the structure of the XML and follows the rules of XML a well formed
XML document.

A valid document and well formed.

```
<carcollection>
  <car>
    <make>DeLorean</make>
    <model>Time Machine</model>
    <year>1981</year>
  </car>
  <car>
    <make>Cadillac</make>
    <model>Ecto-1</model>
    <year>1984</year>
  </car>
</carcollection>
```
### XML Schema Document
Using C# and .NET Framework Class Library to open and navigate through an XML file
Add seven linkLabels and a button
Save the XML document in the bin /debug folder
@”cars.xml” is the location of the XML file
```
// StreamReader will retrieve the file from the source
// and will convert it into a stream ready to be processed
System.IO.StreamReader sr = new System.IO.StreamReader(@"cars.xml");

// XmlTextReader
System.Xml.XmlTextReader xr = new System.Xml.XmlTextReader(sr);

// XmlDocument
System.Xml.XmlDocument carCollectionDoc = new System.Xml.XmlDocument();

carCollectionDoc.Load(xr);

// using the InnerText property will give us just the data
// ... since we are at the entire Document level, it will
// give us *all* the values (no delimiter).
linkLabel1.Text = carCollectionDoc.InnerText;
```
